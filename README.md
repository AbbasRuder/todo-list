# todo-list
 A basic todo-list that allows to add and delete todo task.
 
 It was my first react project and was done following CodewithHarry youtube channel.
 
 Note-for-me : The current code is not working properly because of React router. The course followed a old version of router is outdated now. It needs to be updated with the latest router.
